# FederatedLearning_DeepLearning
Apply Federated Learning and Deep Learning in detecting and classifying malware

Project Objective:
The project aims to apply Federated Learning and Deep Learning for Windows malware detection and classification.

Project Description:
The project utilizes Federated Learning to detect and classify malware on Windows while ensuring data security. By combining Deep Learning, the project focuses on detecting and classifying different types of malware such as Spyware, Trojan, and Ransomware.

Key Points of Focus:
Federated learning maximizes the utilization of data resources on each terminal while guaranteeing information security, compared to the traditional method of copying data from each terminal to the server for model training. By adopting this approach, the project can achieve higher accuracy in model training.
